Input & Output Comments Functions & Comments:First we will discuss about input & output
functions. Before going to Input & Output functions. First we need to know about the funtions.

Functions are nothing but these are the statements which ar grouped together to do
particular task. I will explain about this concept in further classes. Dont worry about
that right now.

Input() Functions(): Now We will discuss about the input & output function. In our program we can ask user
user to enter the information that can be done by using input function.

In Python input() function is input() and if I press enter we can see the blinking cursor
and here we can enter out information.
Example:
>>> input()
'Guido'
"'Guido'"

For the better understanding, We can use some strings along with the input()  fuction.
Example:
>>> input('Please enter your course name: ')
Please enter your course name: Python
'Python'

Output Functions ():  Output fucntions are used to write the strings to the screen.In the
Python print() is used as output function that is print() now we can enter strings here.
Example:
>>> print('Hello Student, Please read Python Tutorials Sincerely: ')
Hello Student, Please read Python Tutorials sincerely:

Using print, We can write value to screen for that first we need to create one variable,
Example: Assign some value to the Variable & print that variable as shown below.
>>> var = 30
>>> print(var)
30

Now We will take one programming example:
name = input('Enter the name: ')
print('Welcome')
print('Hello', name)

Save it as python1.py & run it.

Output would be
--------------------------
Enter the name: Guido
Welcome
Hello Guido

This is about the input() and output() functions in the Python Programming language.

Now We will discuss about the comments. What are the Comments and why do we need
to use the comments & all?
Comments are nothing but these are the description written in our program and these
statements and these statements are ignored during the execution of the program.

& Why we need to use comments. Imagine that You wrote one program today and
after one year or two years You want to use that same code but after one or two
years you may not remember why you used some variables & how the part of program is
executing etc.
So, If you write comments while writing your code, then after one year or two year while
rerefering the code. You can read the description then you can understand why we used
that variable how the part of the code is working and all this is the one reason.

Second reason is  imagine that you are refering the code written by some other developer.
So, You may not understand why he used some variables or how the code is running and
all if he wrote the description. Comments are helpful.

So, Eventually comments are helpful to understand the program.

Now We will see how to use the comments in our program.

#This is my first Program:
print('Hello')

Output would be : Hello

Multiline comments:
     ''' Hi How are you and now you are @ Part3.1. Hope You are enjoying the material
Ok.  Bye Bye Have happy learning '''

Now We will discuss few more fundemental concepts of Python. that is I will use triple
quotes here instead of double quotes and I will goto 'Hello' and I will press enter and I will
close this and I will press enter.

>>> print(''' Hello
Welcome to Python Tutorial Course ''')
 Hello
Welcome to Python Tutorial Course

Thats it for now. WE will move to Control Structures in next session.
