Anonymous Functions:  Every function is identified with def keyword, function name & parameter
list.
But here in anonymous functions, We dont use any function name, any keyword called def
Here we use keyword called lambda. Becuase of this function also called lambda function.

Lets have some example now:

sum = lambda var1 , var2: var1+ var2
print("sum is", sum(10,20))
      
=================== RESTART: C:/Users/vinayb/Desktop/12.py ===================
sum is 30
>>> 

This is about the anonymous function that is function without any name
