Control Structures: These are the Controls which will tell in which order instructions
will be executed in our program.

For Example, Imagine that Your program contain 5lines, These controls will tell which line
will be executed first which line will execute next and which will be executed last.

There are 3types of controls:
     1. Sequential Control
     2.Selection Control
     3.Iterative Control

We will discuss one by one in detail.

1.Sequential Control: As the name Indicates intructions will follow sequenctial order. That
means it will follow the order in which you wrote your program. That is first line of your
code will be executed first then followed by second then third etc.
This is how sequential Control works.
Ex: Regular Print Statements
print('Hi')
print('How have you been today')
print('Yeah Feeling good learning programming')
print('ThankYou')

2.Selection Control: In Selection Control there will be one condition the statements will
execute.
for example if the condition is true then this part of code will be executed if it is false then
other part of the code will be executed.
So, there will be a selection between statements. Hence it is called as Selection Control.
Ex: If - Else Loop
var = int(input('Enter Integer Value: '))
if var<10:
     print('Value is less than 10')
else:
     print('Value is greater than 10')

3. Iterative Control: Here also there will be a condition, If this condition is true, set of statements
will be executed. Again condition will be checked. If it is again true then again this
condition will checked & executed. Until the condition becomes false these statements
are executed repeatedly.If condition becomes false, It comes out from the loop.
Ex: while loops.

var = 0 #Initialization
while var < 10: #Condition
     print(var)
     var = var + 1 #Increment or Decrement


Other than this, There are different types of iterative controls. I will explain it as you
progress in the Course.
