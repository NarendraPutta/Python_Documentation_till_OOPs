Introduction to Operators:
     Based on Operands: 
     Unary Operator
     Binary Operator

Based on Operator:
     Arithmetic Operator
     Relational Operator
     Membership Operator
     Boolean Operator

Operators: Operators are nothing but these are the symbols which are used for the 
computation. For example, +(Plus), -(Minus), *(Multiplication), /(Division)
%(Modulus) etc.

2 + 4 : Here 2 and 4 are called operands & '+' is called Operator.
4 -2 : Here 4 and 2 are called operands. '-' is called operator.

There are different types of operators & Operands.
First we will see the operands: That are Unary Operand & Binary Operand.

Unary Operator: As name indicates, If the single operator is used, that is called 
Unary Operand. ex: -4
Binary Operator: If two operators are used, Then it is called, Binary 
operator. Ex: 2 + 4

Arithmetic Operator: Ex: (+, -, *, /, %, **, //)
 Relational Operator: (Ex: 
==      equal to
!=      not equal to
>       greater than
>=      greater than or equal to
<       less than
<=      less than or equal to

Relational Operators, Membership Operators, Boolean operators are also called as 'Boolean Expressions'
We will discuss more on it Part2.3.py
