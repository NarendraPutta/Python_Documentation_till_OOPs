i.Introduction History & Why Study it:
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in 1990.

Guido Words: â€œOver six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a "hobby" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office ... would be
closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant
of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus).

1.1: Why to Study:
     i.  Very popular: Popular companies like NASA, Yahoo, Google & Facebook are using & One of the Leading Programming Languages of current market
     ii. Easy to understand & Less lines of code without using much curly Brackets & KeyWords
     iii.Best Language for the beginners to enter into the Programming
     iv.Portable: Written in one platform can be executed in other platforms(ie: Written in Windows can be executed in linux, unix & etc)
                                                                                                                                  
1.2. Downloading & Installing Python:
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ & Download latest ie: Python 3.6.1 & click on install to install on your PC.
After the installation. Click on Programs ->   Open IDLE(Python 3.6 32bit) to open Python Interactive Mode.

1.3: How to run Programs:
     i. Python Command Line : Not Required for you as you already know using Python IDLE. Will tell in some free time.
     ii. Microsoft command prompt : Not Required for you as you already know using Python IDLE. Will tell in some free time.
     iii.Python IDLE : You already know as You are running it.
Note: Ensure that If somebody asks interview. you have to say You can run Python Programs in above three ways.

1.4: Fundamental concepts such as Variables, Values:
     i.Values: Values are basic thing in any program. Values can be of different types. Integer: 10, 15, 25, 38888. Floating Type:4.5, 9.8, 12.9, 34.7. Strings: 'Python', 'Monty Python', "Guido"
     ii.Variables: Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory. In programming, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program.
                                                                                                                                    Example: x= 10
                                                                                                                                                   x = x + 1
                                                                                                                                              Now 'x' Value is 11.(So, In this observation, It varies the X value). That is why its called variables.

                                                                                                                                    
                              
1.5: Fundamental Concepts such as Literals, Formats:
     i. Literals: Literals are nothing but one or more charactors which will stand for itself. For example: 10, 15, 25,4.5 etc.
          i.Numerical Literals: As Name indicates, Mumerical literals contain numbers, It may contain sign charactors that are + or -  and it may contain decimal point also ie: 4.1
          ii.String Literals:  The Values which are enclosed in the single quotes or double quotes are called string literals.                                                                                                                                  
     ii.Formats: Format is one of the fundemental concept which is helpful to alter the format of numbers and strings.
          i.For Numericals:
                       (ie: 8/9 o/p : 0.8888888888888888 now  format(8/9, ".3f") o/p: 0.889
          ii. For Strings: In the Case of strings, Format is used for justification. that is left justification right justification & center justification. Ex: format("Hello", '<40') or format("Hello", '>40') or format("Hello", '^40'). Type these to see the difference in IDLE
