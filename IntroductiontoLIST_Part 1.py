Introduction to List:List is the group of different types of elements. In this Chapter what
exactly list is & what are the characterstics of the list and we will see some examples
for list.

First of all whenever I heard the word list, I will remember shopping list that my mother
asks me to write down list of grocerry that I have to buy every sunday. We can relate that
house errands shopping list and this list in the Python are similar.

That is shopping list is the group of differnt types of items right and python list is also is
nothing but that is the group of different types of elements.

LIST:
     MUTABLE
     LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE
     MIXED TYPE ELEMENTS
     VARIABLE LENGTH
     ZERO BASED INDEXING
     
MUTABLE:Ok, Now lets get back to Python & will see the characterstics of the list that is list is mutable.
Mutable is nothing but we can alter the list or we can change the list.

Once You create the list and you want to add some elements or you want to repalce some
element in the list. You can do  that so list is mutable.

LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE: That is elements are arranged in the linear order that is there
will be a first element, second element, third element so, this is called the linear
data structure.

It contains mix type of elements that is a single list can contain integer value, floating value,
or strings. So, It is called mixed type of elements and list is a variable length.

As I said list can be altered or it can be changed whenever you want you can add the element
or you can delete the element. List is of variable length and it is ZERO based indexing.
We all know about indexing right. As Wheneve You open any book, We can see the index
that is topic and page number based on the page number you can goto that conecept
right

indexing is nothing but we will give some value to refer the elements that is in the case
of list  the numbers we will start from ZERO. It is called as ZERO based indexing.

Above are the 5main characterstics of the list.

Now We will see one by one with examples.
